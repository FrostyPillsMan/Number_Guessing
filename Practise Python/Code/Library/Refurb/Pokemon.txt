In this assignment, you are required to build a Java console program of the Pokémon Ga-Ole game. Your program should include the basic features of ‘Battle and Catch’ mode

1. Start Battle and Catch
---> Start the game by generating a random set of Pokémon that will likely appear in the
game.
2. Catch Time
--> Allow player to catch and collect one out of 3 Pokémon.
3. Depart for battle
--> Display the details of two wild Pokémon and allow player to send two of their Pokémon
to the battle.
4. Let's go! Battle!
--> The player’s and opponent’s Pokémon will take turn to attack. When the Pokémon is
attacked, the HP will go down. When it reaches zero, the Pokémon is considered defeated. The
effectiveness of the attack, will be decided by the factors of the defender type and move type.
5. Catch Pokemon
--> When a Pokémon is defeated, players can attempt to catch it using Poke Balls. Stronger
Pokémon may require the use of more powerful Poke Balls for a successful capture.
6. Extra Battle
--> After "Catch Time" ends, there's a chance that an "Extra Battle" will occur! IF an Extra Battle comes up, you can continue battle! *Extra Battles happen at random
7. Check your results! 
--> Calculate and show the battle score (you can apply your own calculation formula).
Allow saving the top 5 score in the top score list (in a file). And, display the top score list.

Based on the files above and the requirements are been stated at the bottom, modify some changes and create a Battle class as well as show battle score
